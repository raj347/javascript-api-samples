THETA S API JavaScript Examples
===============================

Refer to the
[Unofficial API Guide](http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/index.html)
from the THETA Developers community for more information.

JavaScript will not work from within the browser directly. You must
use Node.js or equivalent.

The THETA S will accept a standard HTTP POST command. You can
access the THETA directly with POST. You do not need these modules.
To get you started faster, there are two different node modules
with source code available that handle the connection and parameters:

1. [osc-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc-client) from turbobeast
2. [osc-client-theta_s](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc-client-theta_s) from horihori

Sample code using the node modules in this repository
