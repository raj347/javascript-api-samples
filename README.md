THETA S API JavaScript Examples
===============================

Refer to the
[Unofficial API Guide](http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/index.html)
from the THETA Developers community for more information.

JavaScript will not work from within the browser directly. You must
use Node.js or equivalent.

As the THETA S will accept a standard HTTP POST command, you command
access it directly. To get you started faster,
there are two different node modules:

1. [osc-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc-client) from turbobeast
2. [osc-client-theta_s](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc-client-theta_s) from horihori

Sample code using the node modules in this repository
